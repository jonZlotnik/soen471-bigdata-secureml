## Abstract

In the past 20 years, multi-party computation and homomorphic cryptography have graduated from theoretical constructs to useable protocols. However, the majority of Big Data pipelines and frameworks have yet to incoporate these protocols which could allow users to perform analysis on data they cannot see.

## I. Introduction

Recent advances in applied [modern cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#Modern_cryptography) have  fostered development of several novel projects for computing on private data sets.
Existing pipelines and tools used by Big Data engineers depend on their input remaining in plain text. Unfortunately, the implies that researchers must find ways to de-identify the data they wish to analyze.

The areas of multiparty computation, [homomorphic encryption](https://homomorphicencryption.org/introduction/), and smart-contracts.
